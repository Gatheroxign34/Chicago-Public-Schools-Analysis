        <p> Inquiry: To explore charter, district, independent principal and academy for urban leadership schools' english language learner and special education student graduation rates.</p> 
        <p> Tools & Methods: Calculated the difference in percent of special education and English language learners in each school category using SQLite3 aggregate functions.
